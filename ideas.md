### Codex Vitae (aka Book of Life or Book of Beliefs)
This is an idea coined by [Robin Sloan](https://www.robinsloan.com/) in his book [Mr Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore](http://www.amazon.com/Mr-Penumbras-24-Hour-Bookstore-Novel/dp/1250037751). The idea is to write a book, the Codex Vitae or Book of Life, that represents everything one has learned in their life. I think of it less as a perfect representation of my life or beliefs or thoughts, and more of a snapshot of how I saw the world and which parts of my worldview I would most like to pass on. It's not an easy thing to write, but it's quite rewarding to attempt.
