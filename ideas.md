you change.
All that you change
changes you.

### Codex Vitae (aka Book of Life or Book of Beliefs)
This is an idea coined by [Robin Sloan](https://www.robinsloan.com/) in his book [Mr Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore](https://www.robinsloan.com/books/penumbra/). The idea is to write a book, the Codex Vitae or Book of Life, that represents everything one has learned in their life. I think of it less as a perfect representation of my life or beliefs or thoughts, and more of a snapshot of how I saw the world and which parts of my worldview I would most like to pass on. It's not an easy thing to write, but it's quite rewarding to attempt.

### Prisoner's Dilemma
I love everything about prisoner's dilemma ([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma)) because it is a way to think about collaboration and competition directly, and to even experiment with different ideas to test their practicality in different kinds of situations. It's a little difficult to fully get at first, but then incredibly rich once you do. I've held 3 prisoner's dilemma tournaments the last couple years. The twist on the other games is that in my tournaments people decide on strategies within 3 teams, and so the "dilemma" takes a few different forms: the strategy you have against people on other teams, the strategy your team has against other teams, and the strategy you have within your own team. It has led to some really interesting results that I'm still trying to fully understand. It's a set of questions and ideas that my brain seems to return to when it has a little spare time between other projects.
