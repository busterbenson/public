##### January 2015
*Last month summary:* Launched mobile analytics on iPhone before the holidays, had a great visit from Chris Finley (old highschool friend) and his wife while KA and Niko were in Delaware, celebrated a quiet Christmas (got Niko into Little Bits though), and did NYE at Amy and Thors (where Niko stayed up past midnight for the first time).

### 2014: ++----+----+-

##### December 1st 2014:
*Summary:* Venessa and Lillia visited us for a week; sis, Ryan, and Adelyn visited for 3 days and for Thanksgiving; first big Thanksgiving at the new house (we have chairs); work on front of the house continues, the worst is probably over.

*Weight:* 180 (+2)

*Outcome of previous goal:* Hit! Wrote 750 Words on 22 days.

*New goal:* Write 750 words on 20 or more days, again, because that was good.

##### November 1st 2014:
*Summary:* Started serious work on the outside of the house, attended my 20th year reunion, celebrated our 6th anniversary (Ajanta), and Kellianne's birthday (first party at the new house).

*Weight:* 178

*Outcome of previous goal:* Miss. Did pushups on 0 out of 30 days. Still entirely off the wagon.

*New goal:* Write 750 words on 20 or more days.

##### October 1st 2014:
*Summary:* Amongst other things (that I can't really remember): bought a house, moved in.

*Weight:* 179.0 (-0.4)

*Outcome of previous goal:* Miss. Did pushups on 0 out of 30 days. Completely fell off the wagon.

*New goal:* Do pushups on 2 or more days (low bars ftw)

##### September 1st 2014:
*Summary:* Amongst other things (that I can't really remember): visited Seattle, went to a wedding.

*Weight:* didn't weigh myself this month - my scale is out of batteries

*Outcome of previous goal:* Miss. Did pushups on 1 out of 30 days. Completely fell off the wagon.

*New goal:* Didn't make a goal for this month. Circumstances have disabled my goal-making momentum.

##### August 1st 2014:
*Summary:* Looked at open houses every Sunday, made an offer on a house, lost. Shipped something cool at work. Started a new side project: [Valleyball](http://valleyball.co). Went to yoga at work, once, and failed to go back again (even though I'd like to).

*Weight:* didn't weigh myself this month - my scale is out of batteries

*Outcome of previous goal:* Miss. Did pushups on 9 out of 31 days... definitely did not continue the trend from last month. Circumstances shifted: lots of guests this month, getting my morning routine out of whack, and we were distracted by making an offer on a house (and all the errands that entails). Also, lots of work stuff: shipping Tweet activity dash, starting a new project, performance reviews, etc. As circumstances shift back into the morning routine's favor, I'm hopping back on the pushup wagon this month.

*New goal:* Do pushups on 9 or more days.

*Codex edits:* Added Paul Buchheit's [Startup School talk](http://paulbuchheit.blogspot.com/2014/07/the-technology.html) to my personal canon. 

##### July 1st 2014:
*Weight:* 179.4 (+2.1 - hmmm.)

*Outcome of previous goal:* Hit! Did pushups on 19 out of the 30 days. Also tied my record for slow pushups. Hoping to continue this trend this month.

*New goal:* Do pushups on 19 or more days.

*Notes:* Spent some time this month working on [busterbenson.com](http://busterbenson.com). Added a full-lifetime visualization, and links to my online archive by week. 

##### June 1st 2014: 
*Weight:* 177.3 (+2.6) 

*Outcome of previous goal:* Super miss. I did 60 slow pushups in May (6 out of 31 days: 19%). My 5 month streak of doing fewer pushups each month continues... in fact it was a pretty indulgent and lazy month all around. We spent a week in Richmond for Mother's Day, half-brother meeting, and Rick Webb birthday celebrating. We had the Pixels as guests, we spent a couple days camping in the Redwoods, and even spent a day in Yountville eating at The French Laundry and other delicious restaurants and wineries. We celebrated both Niko and my birthdays. So I gained almost 3 pounds, did barely any pushups, and had a ton of fun doing it all.

*New goal:* Do pushups on 6 or more days. I'm going to focus for a few months on getting back into a daily (or at least semi-daily) pushup routine and not focus on how many. 

*Notes:* I also spent some time re-thinking this monthly review, and have decided to create a bit of a framework that involves a set of things I want to remind myself of daily, monthly, and yearly. My [birthday review](https://medium.com/p/5e72aa44b857) sums it up. And I started a new side project (the first I've allowed myself since shutting down Habit Labs) called [Hyoomans](http://hyoomans.com) which is an attempt to create a game largely inspired by iterated prisoner's dilemma. It's still very early and completely unplayable, but it has been fun to work on when the spare minute arises.

*Changes to codex:* 
* Added descriptions about my top 5 favorite ideas to the lexicon
* Broke out "on privacy" as a separate section in my beliefs
* Added "iterated prisoner's dilemma" to lexicon

##### May 1st 2014: 
*Weight:* 174.7 (+1.4) 

*Outcome of previous goal:* Miss. I did 129 slow pushups in April (12 out of 30 days: 40%). My 4 month streak of doing fewer pushups each month continues... but this month I did switch it up to do even slower pushups than the month before. Instead of resting at the bottom and top of each pushup, I'm trying to keep a constant slow speed at all times. I learned this in slow weights a few years ago and it makes them much harder while also making it harder to "cheat" by hopping up and down too fast.

*New goal:* Do more than 129 slow pushups (only count first set) on 13 or more days. 

##### Apr 1st 2014: 
*Weight:* 173.3 (-0.8) 

*Outcome of previous goal:* Miss. I did 148 slow pushups in March (13 out of 31 days: 42%), but I went from a best of 15 to a best of 18, for a 20% improvement. Totally fell off the wagon (and so far in the first few days of April still off the wagon). Also got sick and didn't get down to 167.1 lbs -- still hovering above 170. Sort of a loser of a month for me all around. Oops!

*New goal:* Do more than 148 slow pushups (only count first set) on 14 or more days. 

##### Mar 1st 2014: 
*Weight:* 174.1 (+1.6) 

*Outcome of previous goal:* Miss. I did 183 slow pushups in Feb (19 out of 28 days: 68%), but I went from a best of 12 to a best of 15, for a 25% improvement. They're definitely starting to feel easier, and I feel like my form is improving. 

*New goal:* Do more than 183 slow pushups (only count first set) on 20 or more days. Also, lose 4% of my weight and get to 167.1 lbs.

##### Feb 1st 2014: 
*Weight:* 172.7 (-0.5)

*Outcome of previous goal:* Hit. I'm only counting the first set of the day, as I found I'm more likely to find the time if I only focus on 1 set. Did 192 last month on 20 out of 28 days. I'm also using pushup bars and doing them in as close to perfect form as I can, very slowly. Finding that 10 slow, good posture pushups is pretty tough. On days when I'm not feeling it, I am fine with doing only a couple -- doing them every day (eventually) is more important than doing a whole bunch on a single day. I want to make this a life-long goal, something I do every day even when I'm 80 years old.

*New goal:* Do more than 192 pushups (only count first set) on 20 or more days.

*Quality moments from previous month:*
* 3rd-5th: Nursing Kellianne with her healing foot post-surgery. Fun for Niko and I to take care of her and watch her watch all of Doctor Who.

* 30th: ModelViewCulture launch party, got to celebrate Amelia's new thing

##### Jan 1st 2014:
*Weight:* 173.2 (+1.6)

*Outcome of previous goal:* Hit

*New goal:* Do pushups at least 4 days a week, find a baseline for pushups in a month that I can try to beat next month. I need to do at least the minimal amount of exercise other than bike riding because I feel like my energy levels are really low. Admittedly, none of my interests have anything to do with pushups... I just choose them because they're the easiest. But there's no internal motivation beyond easiness pushing me forward. Is it possible to enjoy pushups for themselves? If this doesn't work I may need to rely on biking more as my outlet for exercise.

*Quality moments from previous month:* 
* 1st: Went to Scribe with Katie, met up with Mira and Tom
* 6th: Katie stayed with us, we played Cards Against Humanity
* 7th: Picked out a Christmas tree with Bojee and Alycah
* 8th: Hilarious dinner at Paisan with Katie and Jimmy James
* 15th: Went to Tilden Park Carousel with Brasa, Bojee, and friends
* 16th: Made a Thomas train out of construction paper with Niko. Big hit.
* 17th: Inspiring product manager Christmas party, going away party for Mark (our intern)
* 19th: Twitter holiday party: biggest fanciest party we've ever been to (at City Hall)
* 20th: Closed on sale of my Belltown loft! Paid off all credit cards and the car as well. Stoked.
* 21st: Christmas Tree Lane in Alameda
* 24th: Christmas Eve at Kristy's house with Mom, Ryan and Adelyn (Ryan's reading of The Night Before Christmas went over especially well)
* 25th: Adelyn saying "I'm feeling really good right now!" after opening gifts
* 26th: Delicious dinner at Sushi Kimo
* 27th: Great bike ride to Corona del Mar with Kellianne

*Self-declared badges:*
* Sold The House Badge
* Debt Free Badge

* 16-17th: Kellianne’s in Seattle so Niko and I had the weekend to ourselves. A first? Took the opportunity to super-bond with the little guy.
