## Review Every Day
Things I’d like to have primed in my brain every morning. This is stuff currently churning in the front of my brain, which probably has high turnover but which also has a good chance of getting somewhere new.

1. **Cultivate quality time:** With myself, with other people, and with my interests.
2. **Look at what's uneasy:** Don't avoid the unresolved, unwanted, conflicted things that would benefit from attention. 
3. **Slog towards riding a bike on my 100th birthday:** Eat mostly plants. Exercise regularly. Think decades, not days.

## Lexicon
This is an list of ideas that have gotten hopelessly stuck in my brain. 

### Codex Vitae

This is an idea coined by Robin Sloan in his book [Mr Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore](http://www.amazon.com/Mr-Penumbras-24-Hour-Bookstore-Novel/dp/1250037751). The idea is that you write a book, the Codex Vitae or Book of Life, that represents everything you have learned in your life. And it gets stored and read by a privileged few upon your death. Expanding a bit further on it, I think this is a great way of thinking about self-expression. Our lives are filled with a desire to know the universe, and to be known. To leave a dent. This is just my English-major-y way of representing the dent in the form of a text, because words are pretty great. Maybe one day we'll be able to download our brains into a computer and that would more directly represent our full body of knowledge from life.

### Quality Time

My own Codex Vitae's first chapter could possibly be about quality time and its role as the primary ends (and means) for a life well lived. I see 3 kinds of quality time that we should seek out. The first is quality time with our own selves. Know thyself, and in the process find our deep interests and find people that we can connect deeply with. The second is quality time with those interests, and the third is quality time with those people we can connect deeply with. They each feed into each other, you can't really connect deeply with others until you know yourself sufficiently well. And often times interests are strengthened by having people you can connect with and share with. It seems pretty ungameable to me. Seek quality time with yourself, your interests, and others and you will not regret anything on your death bed (see [The Death Bed Game](https://medium.com/better-humans/20cc8d9c7494) for more thoughts around that).

### Kiloslog

My 37th year started off on an exploration of the kiloslog, which is my made-up word representing the idea of working slowly towards a distant goal (see [1 Metric Kiloslog](https://medium.com/better-humans/52167e196771) for a full explanation). I set the goal to do 1,000 small things that would get me closer to running a marathon. I've been thinking about this all year and ended up finally going on a couple 5+ mile runs in the last few weeks after spending almost an entire year working on knee issues. I actually felt quite victorious even with this small goal since the frustration of this particular knee issue has felt extremely frustrating in its lack of progress despite PT, stretching, and lots of patience. I'm still not entirely sure that I'll be able to fully recover without giving in to knee surgery, but since it's gotten a bit better recently I'm holding out hope. That said, I also have a referral for a good local orthopedic surgeon to take a look the second I lose hope. I did stop using technology to track my progress around 900/1000, because I found that the work of tracking was as difficult as the work itself. A common theme in my frustrations with quantified self and self-tracking in general.

In addition to working on the kiloslog towards running a marathon, I've also started fixating on an even longer-term health vision: to ride a bike on my 100th birthday. I like thinking about this for a couple reasons:

1. *It's a silly visualization.* I can actually sort of picture myself, aged 100, getting on a bike and wobbling down the street. Perhaps a crowd is cheering me on. Perhaps we live in a cloud city and we're all cyborgs. The daydream is ripe with material to play around with.
2. *It gives my progress towards health a purpose.* The intrinsic motivation that this taps into is part of my core quality of life motivation. I want to enjoy a long, healthy life, for the purposes of enjoying it all the way through to a simple activity on my 100th birthday.
3. *It's flexible in the short-term but encourages long-term consistency.* I don't have to sweat the small things that aren't going to make a long-term impact, simply because they are part of some program that's supposed to have a short term impact.

This single, silly, vivid health vision informs my eating habits, my exercise routine (for the kiloslog and other stuff), my stress levels, my creativity, and my social habits. It's a single ribbon that ties it all together, paces me, keeps and makes me happy to think about.

### Optionality

Or, as Nassim Nicolas Taleb calls it: [antifragility](http://www.amazon.com/Antifragile-Things-That-Gain-Disorder/dp/1400067820/). I like the word optionality because it seems more neutral, almost boring even, and yet it is probably one of the most simple and powerful ideas that I’ve ever encountered. The easiest way to describe it is the degree to which your eggs are in different baskets. The more baskets, and the more eggs, and the more evenly distributed those eggs are in those baskets, the higher the optionality. The beauty of optionality is that it has both protective and self-strengthening qualities. Say that you have 12 eggs in 1 basket. If something happens to that basket, all of your eggs are doomed (low optionality). On the other hand, say that you have 12 eggs in 6 baskets (2 in each). If something happens to one of the baskets, you still have 10 eggs (higher optionality). Now imagine that you have 12 eggs in 12 baskets, and every time one of the baskets is destroyed, one of the other eggs hatches and creates 2 new eggs and you get 2 new baskets. Now, say that all of the eggs are different colors, and that there are monsters that prefer certain colors of eggs for breakfast. As the monsters wake up every morning and have breakfast, the type of eggs that they like will become more rare. There will be more eggs left from colors that they don’t like. In a way, the set of eggs will become stronger (less likely to be eaten). This is how high optionality works. The final twist is that in order for this to really work, it has to have some level of randomness involved… because what if the monster also adapts over time and begins to prefer new colors of eggs… in order for the set of eggs to be safe from complete elimination, there should be enough variation in the colors that some eggs won’t get eaten… and that those eggs will hatch and grow and the population of future eggs will represent eggs that are less appetizing to monster. Optionality is the key to natural selection and evolution. It’s also the key to idea generation, investment strategy, product management, and many other things. Qualities of high optionality things include:

1. *A variety of options that aren’t connected to one another.* For example, if you have 3 green eggs in 3 baskets and a green-egg eating monster comes, you’re going to lose all of your eggs even though they were in different baskets. Same if you own 3 different houses that are all on the same block and it gets hit by a flood, or 3 different emerging tech stocks when the equity markets dry up. True variety would imply that a disaster of any kind won’t take out all of your options… at least 1 must survive and it needs to be a strong one that has traits that led to its survival. Another word to describe this is that the options must be diversified.
2. *There should be relatively quick feedback loops.* The period of time between “something bad happens” and “the population shifts to favor the stronger options” should be short. If 10 bad things happen before the population adapts, the optionality is lower than if it only takes 1 or 2 bad things to adapt.
3. *The adaptations must have some element of randomness.* In other words, variety must not decrease over time, even if the environment becomes predictable. Eventually the environment will change in a new way, and then the variety will need to be sufficient to survive an unexpected change. If a green-egg eating monster turns into a red-egg eating monster, there should be some non-red eggs, and maybe even some green eggs, around.

This makes logical sense, but in practice it seems counter-intuitive to build systems with high optionality. We tend to build systems that converge on a single design over time (see monocultures) because they are predictable and efficient in a given environment. But environments change, and without the ability to predict how those changes will happen ahead of time, optionality is required even in the safest of environments.

I rambled on even longer about this topic here: [Live like a hydra](https://medium.com/better-humans/c02337782a89).

### Soloverse

**Soloverse:** This is the least-fully-formed idea of the bunch and something that I’m sure will shift over time. The universe is this giant space/time environment that we are all a part of. The *soloverse* is our mental model of the universe that our brain uses to *think about* the universe and everything in it. It turns out, we can’t really think about the universe directly (it’s way too big), we can only think about our mental model of the universe as it exists in our soloverse.

I first came across this idea last year and found some interesting explorations of the idea referenced by the word *umwelt*, which is German for “environment” or “surroundings” and pronounced *oom-velt*. I just made up the term soloverse because it’s easier for me to think of it as a private universe in our minds.

A few thoughts about soloverses:

1. *The soloverse is our local cache of the universe.* When we’re babies, our caches are not very primed, and we are forced to take in the full firehose of the universe… unsorted, uncategorized, raw. It’s overwhelming. Our brains are designed to start building this soloverse almost immediately in order to gain some foothold on the raw craziness of all the information coming in. The soloverse is built up from basic building blocks like light and dark, smells, sounds, and eventually patterns (mom, hungry, cold, soft), and then eventually concepts (blanket, food) and meanings (safe, scared, good, bad).
2. *What we think of as the universe is actually our soloverse.* From these basic building blocks we create beliefs and build simulations that allow us to predict future occurrences (if I cry, mom will come to me). At some point we arrive at a concept of our own selves and other people. “The concept of a person is arguably the most important interface ever developed.” — [Kevin Smokler](http://kevinsimler.quora.com/UX-and-the-Civilizing-Process)
3. *The soloverse contains gods and archetypes.* Some of our most powerful beliefs and traditional characters (God, the hero, the devil, the wizard, the fairy godmother) all exist only in our soloverses. Unicorns, dragons, Santa, astrology, luck, fairness, truth, good and evil, beginning middle and end, physics, etc are all shadows of the structure that our soloverse is running on (our brains, and the pattern matching hierarchies that they are built from) and most likely absent from the universe that they are attempting to model. This quirk is actually really fascinating to explore.
4. *The soloverse is the most powerful tool we have.* The model of the universe that we each have is highly personal, and idiosyncratic to the experiences we’ve had. There are also large portions of which there is probably lots of overlap (common sense, myths, popular culture, things we learn in school, etc). An unhealthy soloverse could lead to poor/misinformed decision-making. An unhealthy soloverse could be responsible for cruelty, prejudice, hatred, wars, and all kinds of other unfortunate things. What could we do to help ourselves and each other have healthier soloverses? Could we address this issue directly and have an impact?
5. *A comprehensively complete soloverse must also model every other soloverse that exists.* In order to build a real “to scale” model of the universe it has to also include every other soloverse out there, including itself. We can’t escape our personal soloverse, but we can make it a more hospitable place to live in the meantime.

### Iterated prisoner's dilemma

I started a [new side project](http://hyoomans.com) in May of 2014 to explore the world of iterated prisoner's dilemma strategies. Basically, an attempt to solve, through games, a philosophical problem: what is the right strategy for being nice vs mean in an unpredictable and changing world? ([background on iterated prisoner's dilemma](http://hyoomans.com/t/welcome-to-hyoomans/6))

This interests me for a number of reasons.

1. It's an unsolved problem in sociology and psychology: what is the optimal strategy for cooperation/selflessness? Is there one that works in all possible circumstances or is there a logic to how a given set of circumstances creates an optimal strategy?  
2. It has been explored to some extent, but there is by no means a full exploration of the space. The space to explore is finite, but extremely complex. There is an opportunity for a sufficiently flexible system to make progress on this problem fairly easily.
3. I like the idea of using technology to solve a fundamental psychological riddle. It's fun.

For now I'm just dabbling my toes in the idea, but I hope to slowly make progress on it on [hyoomans.com](http://hyoomans.com). So far it's probably still too amorphous to have much popular interest. The hook is still buried in technicalities. Hoping to change that in the next couple months.

# Monthly Reports

### 2014: ++----+-

##### August 1st 2014:
*Summary:* Looked at open houses every Sunday, made an offer on a house, lost. Shipped something cool at work. Started a new side project: [Valleyball](http://valleyball.co). Went to yoga at work, once, and failed to go back again (even though I'd like to).

*Weight:* didn't weigh myself this month - my scale is out of batteries

*Outcome of previous goal:* Miss. Did pushups on 9 out of 31 days... definitely did not continue the trend from last month. Circumstances shifted: lots of guests this month, getting my morning routine out of whack, and we were distracted by making an offer on a house (and all the errands that entails). Also, lots of work stuff: shipping Tweet activity dash, starting a new project, performance reviews, etc. As circumstances shift back into the morning routine's favor, I'm hopping back on the pushup wagon this month.

*New goal:* Do pushups on 9 or more days.

*Codex edits:* Added Paul Buchheit's [Startup School talk](http://paulbuchheit.blogspot.com/2014/07/the-technology.html) to my personal canon. 

##### July 1st 2014:
*Weight:* 179.4 (+2.1 - hmmm.)

*Outcome of previous goal:* Hit! Did pushups on 19 out of the 30 days. Also tied my record for slow pushups. Hoping to continue this trend this month.

*New goal:* Do pushups on 19 or more days.

*Notes:* Spent some time this month working on [busterbenson.com](http://busterbenson.com). Added a full-lifetime visualization, and links to my online archive by week. 

##### June 1st 2014: 
*Weight:* 177.3 (+2.6) 

*Outcome of previous goal:* Super miss. I did 60 slow pushups in May (6 out of 31 days: 19%). My 5 month streak of doing fewer pushups each month continues... in fact it was a pretty indulgent and lazy month all around. We spent a week in Richmond for Mother's Day, half-brother meeting, and Rick Webb birthday celebrating. We had the Pixels as guests, we spent a couple days camping in the Redwoods, and even spent a day in Yountville eating at The French Laundry and other delicious restaurants and wineries. We celebrated both Niko and my birthdays. So I gained almost 3 pounds, did barely any pushups, and had a ton of fun doing it all.

*New goal:* Do pushups on 6 or more days. I'm going to focus for a few months on getting back into a daily (or at least semi-daily) pushup routine and not focus on how many. 

*Notes:* I also spent some time re-thinking this monthly review, and have decided to create a bit of a framework that involves a set of things I want to remind myself of daily, monthly, and yearly. My [birthday review](https://medium.com/p/5e72aa44b857) sums it up. And I started a new side project (the first I've allowed myself since shutting down Habit Labs) called [Hyoomans](http://hyoomans.com) which is an attempt to create a game largely inspired by iterated prisoner's dilemma. It's still very early and completely unplayable, but it has been fun to work on when the spare minute arises.

*Changes to codex:* 
* Added descriptions about my top 5 favorite ideas to the lexicon
* Broke out "on privacy" as a separate section in my beliefs
* Added "iterated prisoner's dilemma" to lexicon

##### May 1st 2014: 
*Weight:* 174.7 (+1.4) 

*Outcome of previous goal:* Miss. I did 129 slow pushups in April (12 out of 30 days: 40%). My 4 month streak of doing fewer pushups each month continues... but this month I did switch it up to do even slower pushups than the month before. Instead of resting at the bottom and top of each pushup, I'm trying to keep a constant slow speed at all times. I learned this in slow weights a few years ago and it makes them much harder while also making it harder to "cheat" by hopping up and down too fast.

*New goal:* Do more than 129 slow pushups (only count first set) on 13 or more days. 

##### Apr 1st 2014: 
*Weight:* 173.3 (-0.8) 

*Outcome of previous goal:* Miss. I did 148 slow pushups in March (13 out of 31 days: 42%), but I went from a best of 15 to a best of 18, for a 20% improvement. Totally fell off the wagon (and so far in the first few days of April still off the wagon). Also got sick and didn't get down to 167.1 lbs -- still hovering above 170. Sort of a loser of a month for me all around. Oops!

*New goal:* Do more than 148 slow pushups (only count first set) on 14 or more days. 

##### Mar 1st 2014: 
*Weight:* 174.1 (+1.6) 

*Outcome of previous goal:* Miss. I did 183 slow pushups in Feb (19 out of 28 days: 68%), but I went from a best of 12 to a best of 15, for a 25% improvement. They're definitely starting to feel easier, and I feel like my form is improving. 

*New goal:* Do more than 183 slow pushups (only count first set) on 20 or more days. Also, lose 4% of my weight and get to 167.1 lbs.

##### Feb 1st 2014: 
*Weight:* 172.7 (-0.5)

*Outcome of previous goal:* Hit. I'm only counting the first set of the day, as I found I'm more likely to find the time if I only focus on 1 set. Did 192 last month on 20 out of 28 days. I'm also using pushup bars and doing them in as close to perfect form as I can, very slowly. Finding that 10 slow, good posture pushups is pretty tough. On days when I'm not feeling it, I am fine with doing only a couple -- doing them every day (eventually) is more important than doing a whole bunch on a single day. I want to make this a life-long goal, something I do every day even when I'm 80 years old.

*New goal:* Do more than 192 pushups (only count first set) on 20 or more days.

##### Jan 1st 2014:
*Weight:* 173.2 (+1.6)

*Outcome of previous goal:* Hit

*New goal:* Do pushups at least 4 days a week, find a baseline for pushups in a month that I can try to beat next month. I need to do at least the minimal amount of exercise other than bike riding because I feel like my energy levels are really low. Admittedly, none of my interests have anything to do with pushups... I just choose them because they're the easiest. But there's no internal motivation beyond easiness pushing me forward. Is it possible to enjoy pushups for themselves? If this doesn't work I may need to rely on biking more as my outlet for exercise.
