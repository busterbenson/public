# Codex Vitae

## How to play

1. **Every day:** In the morning, read Review Every Day
2. **Every month:** On the 1st of every month, read Review Every Month
3. **Every year:** On your birthday, read Review Every Year

## Review Every Day
Things I’d like to have primed in my brain every morning. Basically attempts to set a part of my brain to always be on the lookout for specific things that I want to be sure to catch. Use my subconscious to my advantage. 

1. **Remember the soloverse:** What I think is the universe is actually my mental model of the universe (the soloverse). Don't forget.
2. **Look for invisible things:** *Anomalies* are inconsistencies between my internal model of the universe / soloverse, and new information. Resist the urge to move these anomalies into the trash bin, they are clues. *Life circumstances* fade into the background but can both hinder and enable my growth if used correctly. *Internal, automated, voices* whisper stories that have been hard-coded in my head over time as indisputable facts. All three of these invisible things (anomalies, circumstances, voices) naturally live in my blind spot, but noticing them could be useful.
3. **Engineer quality time:** Look for opportunities to enjoy quality time with myself, other people, and my interests.

## Review Every Month

## Favorite Ideas
This is an list of ideas that have gotten hopelessly stuck in my brain. 

### Codex Vitae

This is an idea coined by Robin Sloan in his book [Mr Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore](http://www.amazon.com/Mr-Penumbras-24-Hour-Bookstore-Novel/dp/1250037751). The idea is that you write a book, the Codex Vitae or Book of Life, that represents everything you have learned in your life. And it gets stored and read by a privileged few upon your death. Expanding a bit further on it, I think this is a great way of thinking about self-expression and capturing the meaning that we create in our lives.

### Quality Time

My own Codex Vitae's first chapter could possibly be about quality time and its role as the primary ends (and means) for a life well lived. I see 3 kinds of quality time that we should seek out. The first is quality time with our own selves. Know thyself, and in the process find our deep interests and find people that we can connect deeply with. The second is quality time with those interests, and the third is quality time with those people we can connect deeply with. They each feed into each other: you can't really connect deeply with others until you know yourself sufficiently well; often times interests are strengthened by having people you can connect with and share with. It seems pretty ungameable to me. Seek quality time with yourself, your interests, and others and you will not regret anything on your death bed.

### Optionality

Or, as Nassim Nicolas Taleb calls it: [antifragility](http://www.amazon.com/Antifragile-Things-That-Gain-Disorder/dp/1400067820/). I like the word optionality because it seems more neutral, almost boring even, and yet it is probably one of the most simple and powerful ideas that I’ve ever encountered. The easiest way to describe it is the degree to which your eggs are in different baskets. 

The more baskets, and the more eggs, and the more evenly distributed those eggs are in those baskets, the greater your chances that any single event won't wipe you out of eggs entirely, and the greater your chances that one of those eggs is going to be amazing. The beauty of optionality is that it has both protective and self-strengthening qualities. Sticking with the metaphor, say that you have 12 eggs in 1 basket. If something happens to that basket, all of your eggs are doomed (low optionality). On the other hand, say that you have 12 eggs in 6 baskets (2 in each). If something happens to one of the baskets, you still have 10 eggs (higher optionality). Now imagine that you have 12 eggs in 12 baskets, all of the eggs are different colors, and there are monsters that prefer certain colors of eggs for breakfast. As the monsters wake up every morning and have breakfast, the type of eggs that they like will become more rare. There will be more remaining eggs with colors that they don’t like. In a way, the remaining set of eggs has become stronger (less likely to be eaten) than the set was previously. This is how high optionality works. The final twist is that in order for this to really work, it has to have some level of randomness involved… because what if the monster also adapts over time and begins to prefer new colors of eggs? In order for the eggs to be safe from complete elimination, there should be enough variation in the colors that some eggs won’t get eaten, and those eggs will need to hatch and grow and the population of future eggs will represent eggs that are less appetizing to monster. Optionality is the key to natural selection and evolution. It’s also the key to idea generation, investment strategy, product management, and many other things. 

In practice it seems counter-intuitive to build systems with high optionality. We tend to build systems that converge on a single design over time (see monocultures) because they are predictable and efficient in a given environment. But environments change, and without the ability to predict how those changes will happen ahead of time, optionality is required even in the safest of environments.

### Soloverse

**Soloverse:** This is my word for an idea I'm obsessed with. It goes something like this: the universe is this giant space/time environment that we are all a part of. The *soloverse* is our mental model of that universe that our brain uses to *think about* the universe and everything in it. It turns out, we can’t really think about the universe directly (it’s way too big), we can only think about our mental model of the universe as it exists in our soloverse. Lots of interesting (to me) side effects result from this distinction.

I first came across this idea last year and found some interesting explorations of the idea referenced by the word *umwelt*, which is German for “environment” or “surroundings” and pronounced *oom-velt*. I just made up the term soloverse because it’s easier for me to think of it as a private universe in our minds.

A few thoughts about soloverses:

1. *The soloverse is our local cache of the universe.* When we’re babies, our caches are not very full, and we're forced to take in the full firehose of the universe… unsorted, uncategorized, raw. It’s overwhelming. Our brains are designed to start building this soloverse almost immediately in order to gain some foothold on the raw craziness of all the information coming in. The soloverse is built up from basic building blocks like light and dark, smells, sounds, and eventually patterns (mom, hungry, cold, soft), and then eventually concepts (blanket, food) and meanings (safe, scared, good, bad).
2. *What we think of as the universe is actually our soloverse.* From these basic building blocks we create beliefs and build simulations that allow us to predict future occurrences (if I cry, mom will come to me). At some point we arrive at a concept of our own selves and other people. “The concept of a person is arguably the most important interface ever developed.” — [Kevin Smokler](http://kevinsimler.quora.com/UX-and-the-Civilizing-Process)
3. *The soloverse contains gods and archetypes and the self.* Some of our most powerful beliefs and traditional characters (God, the hero, the devil, the wizard, the fairy godmother, even our concept of our self) all exist only in our soloverses. Unicorns, dragons, Santa, astrology, luck, fairness, truth, good and evil, beginning middle and end, physics, etc are all shadows of the structure that our soloverse is running on (our brains, and the pattern matching hierarchies that they are built from) and most likely absent from the universe that they are attempting to model. This quirk is actually really fascinating to explore.
4. *The soloverse is the most powerful tool we have.* The model of the universe that we each have is highly personal, and idiosyncratic to the experiences we’ve had. There are also large portions of which there is probably lots of overlap (common sense, myths, popular culture, things we learn in school, etc). An unhealthy soloverse will lead to poor/misinformed decision-making. An unhealthy soloverse could be responsible for cruelty, prejudice, hatred, wars, and all kinds of other unfortunate things. What could we do to help ourselves and each other have healthier soloverses? Could we address this issue directly and have an impact?
5. *A comprehensively complete soloverse must also model every other soloverse that exists.* In order to build a real “to scale” model of the universe it has to also include every other soloverse out there, including itself. We can’t escape our personal soloverse, but we can make it a more hospitable place to live in the meantime.

### Quantum realism

Quantum realism is a term I first learned from [an article](http://listverse.com/2014/11/26/10-reasons-why-our-universe-is-a-virtual-reality/) by Brian Whitmore, a senior lecturer in computing at Massey University. The idea is in opposition to "physical realism" (that belief that the physical world we see is real and exists by itself, alone). Quantum realism asserts that the physical world isn't real in itself, but merely the output (or shadow, or result, or projected image) of a quantum reality that is generating it. It's basically a virtual reality, or a simulation.

I'm still learning about this and definitely couldn't explain or defend it, but I'm fascinated by the idea and keep thinking about it.

1. Free will is mostly an illusion (but does exist in limited form)
2. Pure altruism is an illusion (but kindness is not)
3. We tell stories in order to create and remember meaning (they fit our brain)
4. Consciousness is the result of a feedback loop between our story-making cortex and our subconscious, so that it can better predict/act on long-term threats
5. We are all running an incomplete simulation of the universe in our heads (the soloverse) and usually mistake it for the real universe 

### On Privacy
1. Privacy is just a side effect of people not being truly connected
2. People, organizations, and governments will exchange privacy for connection when/if they eventually trust each other

4. Giving up our privacy and individuality in exchange for better connection will be the norm by 2050

### On Logic
1. Most questions have no answer (asking them anyway is sometimes entertaining, but nothing else) 
2. Logic is a helpful tool, but has flaws and can't be relied on entirely

### On Education
1. Something will replace universities (as we currently know them) as the majority path towards advanced education by 2030
2. Playing lots of games (of any kind: video, board, card, other) in your youth will make you smarter than people who don't 

### On Politics & The Economy
1. It should be easier and more expedient to put neglectful and irresponsible public servants in prison than the average citizen, not slower and more difficult
2. Most jobs lost between 2008-2012 aren't going to come back, new ones have to be created from scratch (or not)
3. In the future, working will be more thoroughly decoupled from having the means to live (see disability trends as proxy for this)

2. Love at first sight happens

### Meta
1. We have very little control over what we believe in
2. Some of my beliefs will be proven wrong
3. I'm willing to be convinced that my beliefs are wrong
4. Making and maintaining this list is useful and fun (you should do it too)

### Wagers
1. With Carinna. By 2028, the equivalent of a college education (both in breadth of knowledge and value to career) will be available to anyone with an internet connection.
2. With Rick Webb. By March 1st, 2016, descendants of Google Glass will be seen regularly in the wild (in the same way that Fitbits, NikeFuel bands, and retina MacBook Pros are in 2013).

##### January 2015
*Last month summary:* Launched mobile analytics on iPhone before the holidays, had a great visit from Chris Finley (old highschool friend) and his wife while KA and Niko were in Delaware, celebrated a quiet Christmas (got Niko into Little Bits though), and did NYE at Amy and Thors (where Niko stayed up past midnight for the first time).

*Weight:* 181.2 (+1.2 m/m, +7 y/y -- bad trend!)

*Outcome of previous goal:* MISS. Wrote my 750 words on 11 days (hoping for 20). 

*New goal:* Upholding the yearly tradition of health month in January with some friends: no alcohol, coffee, drugs, refined flour/sugar, dairy, white rice, or red meat. I'm allowing 1 amnesty day where I can break all the rules. Write 750 words on 11 or more days.

*Interests:*
* Co-active coaching, Motivational coaching
* Quantum realism: read all of Brian Whitworth's [published chapters](http://brianwhitworth.com/BW-VRT1.pdf)
* History of the Transformers shows/comics: starting with [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformers) and ending up on [Unicron's tfwiki.net page](http://tfwiki.net/wiki/Unicron)

### 2014: ++----+----+-

##### December 1st 2014:
*Summary:* Venessa and Lillia visited us for a week; sis, Ryan, and Adelyn visited for 3 days and for Thanksgiving; first big Thanksgiving at the new house (we have chairs); work on front of the house continues, the worst is probably over.

*Weight:* 180 (+2)

*Outcome of previous goal:* Hit! Wrote 750 Words on 22 days.

*New goal:* Write 750 words on 20 or more days, again, because that was good.

##### November 1st 2014:
*Summary:* Started serious work on the outside of the house, attended my 20th year reunion, celebrated our 6th anniversary (Ajanta), and Kellianne's birthday (first party at the new house).

*Weight:* 178

*Outcome of previous goal:* Miss. Did pushups on 0 out of 30 days. Still entirely off the wagon.

*New goal:* Write 750 words on 20 or more days.

##### October 1st 2014:
*Summary:* Amongst other things (that I can't really remember): bought a house, moved in.

*Weight:* 179.0 (-0.4)

*Outcome of previous goal:* Miss. Did pushups on 0 out of 30 days. Completely fell off the wagon.

*New goal:* Do pushups on 2 or more days (low bars ftw)

##### September 1st 2014:
*Summary:* Amongst other things (that I can't really remember): visited Seattle, went to a wedding.

*Weight:* didn't weigh myself this month - my scale is out of batteries

*Outcome of previous goal:* Miss. Did pushups on 1 out of 30 days. Completely fell off the wagon.

*New goal:* Didn't make a goal for this month. Circumstances have disabled my goal-making momentum.

##### August 1st 2014:
*Summary:* Looked at open houses every Sunday, made an offer on a house, lost. Shipped something cool at work. Started a new side project: [Valleyball](http://valleyball.co). Went to yoga at work, once, and failed to go back again (even though I'd like to).

*Weight:* didn't weigh myself this month - my scale is out of batteries

*Outcome of previous goal:* Miss. Did pushups on 9 out of 31 days... definitely did not continue the trend from last month. Circumstances shifted: lots of guests this month, getting my morning routine out of whack, and we were distracted by making an offer on a house (and all the errands that entails). Also, lots of work stuff: shipping Tweet activity dash, starting a new project, performance reviews, etc. As circumstances shift back into the morning routine's favor, I'm hopping back on the pushup wagon this month.

*New goal:* Do pushups on 9 or more days.

*Codex edits:* Added Paul Buchheit's [Startup School talk](http://paulbuchheit.blogspot.com/2014/07/the-technology.html) to my personal canon. 

##### July 1st 2014:
*Weight:* 179.4 (+2.1 - hmmm.)

*Outcome of previous goal:* Hit! Did pushups on 19 out of the 30 days. Also tied my record for slow pushups. Hoping to continue this trend this month.

*New goal:* Do pushups on 19 or more days.

*Notes:* Spent some time this month working on [busterbenson.com](http://busterbenson.com). Added a full-lifetime visualization, and links to my online archive by week. 

##### June 1st 2014: 
*Weight:* 177.3 (+2.6) 

*Outcome of previous goal:* Super miss. I did 60 slow pushups in May (6 out of 31 days: 19%). My 5 month streak of doing fewer pushups each month continues... in fact it was a pretty indulgent and lazy month all around. We spent a week in Richmond for Mother's Day, half-brother meeting, and Rick Webb birthday celebrating. We had the Pixels as guests, we spent a couple days camping in the Redwoods, and even spent a day in Yountville eating at The French Laundry and other delicious restaurants and wineries. We celebrated both Niko and my birthdays. So I gained almost 3 pounds, did barely any pushups, and had a ton of fun doing it all.

*New goal:* Do pushups on 6 or more days. I'm going to focus for a few months on getting back into a daily (or at least semi-daily) pushup routine and not focus on how many. 

*Notes:* I also spent some time re-thinking this monthly review, and have decided to create a bit of a framework that involves a set of things I want to remind myself of daily, monthly, and yearly. My [birthday review](https://medium.com/p/5e72aa44b857) sums it up. And I started a new side project (the first I've allowed myself since shutting down Habit Labs) called [Hyoomans](http://hyoomans.com) which is an attempt to create a game largely inspired by iterated prisoner's dilemma. It's still very early and completely unplayable, but it has been fun to work on when the spare minute arises.

*Changes to codex:* 
* Added descriptions about my top 5 favorite ideas to the lexicon
* Broke out "on privacy" as a separate section in my beliefs
* Added "iterated prisoner's dilemma" to lexicon

##### May 1st 2014: 
*Weight:* 174.7 (+1.4) 

*Outcome of previous goal:* Miss. I did 129 slow pushups in April (12 out of 30 days: 40%). My 4 month streak of doing fewer pushups each month continues... but this month I did switch it up to do even slower pushups than the month before. Instead of resting at the bottom and top of each pushup, I'm trying to keep a constant slow speed at all times. I learned this in slow weights a few years ago and it makes them much harder while also making it harder to "cheat" by hopping up and down too fast.

*New goal:* Do more than 129 slow pushups (only count first set) on 13 or more days. 

##### Apr 1st 2014: 
*Weight:* 173.3 (-0.8) 

*Outcome of previous goal:* Miss. I did 148 slow pushups in March (13 out of 31 days: 42%), but I went from a best of 15 to a best of 18, for a 20% improvement. Totally fell off the wagon (and so far in the first few days of April still off the wagon). Also got sick and didn't get down to 167.1 lbs -- still hovering above 170. Sort of a loser of a month for me all around. Oops!

*New goal:* Do more than 148 slow pushups (only count first set) on 14 or more days. 

##### Mar 1st 2014: 
*Weight:* 174.1 (+1.6) 

*Outcome of previous goal:* Miss. I did 183 slow pushups in Feb (19 out of 28 days: 68%), but I went from a best of 12 to a best of 15, for a 25% improvement. They're definitely starting to feel easier, and I feel like my form is improving. 

*New goal:* Do more than 183 slow pushups (only count first set) on 20 or more days. Also, lose 4% of my weight and get to 167.1 lbs.

##### Feb 1st 2014: 
*Weight:* 172.7 (-0.5)

*Outcome of previous goal:* Hit. I'm only counting the first set of the day, as I found I'm more likely to find the time if I only focus on 1 set. Did 192 last month on 20 out of 28 days. I'm also using pushup bars and doing them in as close to perfect form as I can, very slowly. Finding that 10 slow, good posture pushups is pretty tough. On days when I'm not feeling it, I am fine with doing only a couple -- doing them every day (eventually) is more important than doing a whole bunch on a single day. I want to make this a life-long goal, something I do every day even when I'm 80 years old.

*New goal:* Do more than 192 pushups (only count first set) on 20 or more days.

##### Jan 1st 2014:
*Weight:* 173.2 (+1.6)

*Outcome of previous goal:* Hit

*New goal:* Do pushups at least 4 days a week, find a baseline for pushups in a month that I can try to beat next month. I need to do at least the minimal amount of exercise other than bike riding because I feel like my energy levels are really low. Admittedly, none of my interests have anything to do with pushups... I just choose them because they're the easiest. But there's no internal motivation beyond easiness pushing me forward. Is it possible to enjoy pushups for themselves? If this doesn't work I may need to rely on biking more as my outlet for exercise.

*Quality moments from previous month:* 
* 1st: Went to Scribe with Katie, met up with Mira and Tom
* 6th: Katie stayed with us, we played Cards Against Humanity
* 7th: Picked out a Christmas tree with Bojee and Alycah
* 8th: Hilarious dinner at Paisan with Katie and Jimmy James
* 15th: Went to Tilden Park Carousel with Brasa, Bojee, and friends
* 16th: Made a Thomas train out of construction paper with Niko. Big hit.
* 17th: Inspiring product manager Christmas party, going away party for Mark (our intern)
* 19th: Twitter holiday party: biggest fanciest party we've ever been to (at City Hall)
* 20th: Closed on sale of my Belltown loft! Paid off all credit cards and the car as well. Stoked.
* 21st: Christmas Tree Lane in Alameda
* 24th: Christmas Eve at Kristy's house with Mom, Ryan and Adelyn (Ryan's reading of The Night Before Christmas went over especially well)
* 25th: Adelyn saying "I'm feeling really good right now!" after opening gifts
* 26th: Delicious dinner at Sushi Kimo
* 27th: Great bike ride to Corona del Mar with Kellianne
