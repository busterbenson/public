## Lexicon

## Beliefs

### On the purpose of life
- We don't have a purpose given to us, but we are allowed to make one up
- My meta-purpose is to increase quality time (with myself, with others, and with my interests)
- The best strategy to increase quality time: weaken the circumstances that hinder quality time, and strengthen the circumstances that encourage quality time
- He who dies having experienced the most quality time wins

### On personal conduct
- I must strive to know what I really believe
- I must not dilly-dally
- I must be my word
- I must have good intentions
- I must admit to being the maker of my own meaning
- I must not feel sorry for myself
- I must have a vision that I'm are striving for
- I must rally others with my vision
- I must tie creativity and experimentation with survival
- I must be the change I want to see
- I must stake my reputation on my better self
- I must be comfortable with the consequences of being who I am
- I must make my own advice and take it
- I must manage my stress, health, and clarity
- I must study my mistakes
- I must retry things I don’t like every once in a while
- I must go slow, work hard, and avoid shortcuts
- I must cultivate quality time with myself, with others, and with my interests
- I must face things that make me uncomfortable

### On Morality
- Being good/moral increasingly becomes our default state as we learn more about the world and are more connected with others
- Gay marriage should be legal everywhere
- Abortion should be legal everywhere
- Assisted suicide should be legal everywhere
- Health care should be available to everyone who needs it
- The death penalty should be used in extreme and certain cases to protect the public
- Prisons should be about protecting the public, not about punishment
- Marijuana should be legal to grow, sell, buy, and carry
- Owning a gun should require certification from a firearms officer verifying that they've taken a safety course, are free of criminal record, and pass a psychological mental health check every few years
- You don't need to ask permission to take responsibility for something that you find important (but you may not get credit)

### On Spirituality
- Frequently remembering we will die increases the quality of our life
- Souls don't exist separate from the physical body
- The Gods of organized religion don't exist
- Intention can't create reality (it just primes our perception of it)
- Astrology is entertainment
- Magic and miracles don't exist outside the explanations of science
- There is no heaven/hell

### On Science & The Universe
- Chances are, we live in a simulation
- Other dimensions and universes exist
- Micro and macro evolution happens
- Something like the Big Bang happened, and will probably happen again
- Something existed before the Big Bang (outside of time and space as we know them)
- Nothing in our universe can travel faster than light
- The human brain (in its current state of evolution) can't comprehend the universe
- We have no cosmic significance
- Aliens exist
- Non-carbon-based life forms exist
- Space travel throughout the universe is probably entirely the domain of robots and cyborgs
- Perception of time can be sped up or slowed down, but not reversed (forwards time travel is possible, backwards is not)

### On Health
- We can change our behavior and habits (it requires a lot of energy)
- Consistently eating well and exercising is the only way to be sustainably healthy
- Acupuncture works, somehow
- Vaccinations are good for babies and society

### On Technology
- Computers will be building better computers than humans by 2050 (the Singularity)
- Humans, computers, and Earth will evolve into a super organism by 2200 (if we're still around)
- Humans that embrace change (and give up some of their humanity) will survive the Singularity
- Technology will eventually disrupt all other human-created institutions (politics, religion, identity, economics)

### On The Self
- Free will is mostly an illusion (but does exist in limited form)
- Pure altruism is an illusion (but kindness is not)
- We tell stories in order to create and remember meaning
- Consciousness is the result of a feedback loop between our story-making cortex and our subconscious, so that it can better predict/act on long-term threats
- Privacy is just a side effect of people not being truly connected
- People, organizations, and governments will exchange privacy for connection when/if they eventually trust each other
- Future-thinking people, organizations, and governments will make great strides towards being more trustworthy in order to earn this privilege of connection by 2050
- Giving up our privacy and individuality in exchange for better connection will be the norm by 2050

### On Logic
- Most questions have no answer (asking them anyway is sometimes entertaining, but nothing else) 
- Logic is a helpful tool, but has flaws and can't be relied on entirely

### On Education
- Something will replace universities as we currently know them by 2030

### On Politics & The Economy
- Most jobs lost between 2008-2012 aren't going to come back, new ones have to be created from scratch (or not)
- In the future, working will be more thoroughly decoupled from having the means to live (see disability trends as proxy for this)
- We'll have a President that admits to being atheist or agnostic by 2025
- Power will be more quickly redistributed when it gets too heavy at the top

### On The Future Of Earth (2100)
- Global warming is real and will continue to cause bigger and bigger problems
- There will be 10 billion people
- 80% of people will live in cities and new mega-cities by 2100
- The number of living languages in the world will drop to under 100
- Genetically modified foods will become the norm
- Coral reefs and the ocean ecosystems are going to break with unknown consequences
- Solar and wind will slowly replace gas and oil 

### On Biases
- We tend to favor the beautiful
- We tend to see what we expect to see
- We tend to attribute too much credit to success (and under-credit luck)

### On Love
- Soulmates exist
- Love at first sight happens

### Meta
- We have very little control over what we believe in
- Some of my beliefs will be proven wrong
- I'm willing to be convinced that my beliefs are wrong
- Making and maintaining this list is useful and fun (you should do it too)

### Wagers
- With Carinna. By 2028, the equivalent of a college education (both in breadth of knowledge and value to career) will be available to anyone with an internet connection.
- With Rick Webb. By March 1st, 2016, descendants of Google Glass will be seen regularly in the wild (in the same way that Fitbits, NikeFuel bands, and retina MacBook Pros are in 2013).

# Monthly Reports

### 2014: ++---

##### May 1st 2014: 
*Weight:* 174.7 (+1.4) 

*Outcome of previous goal:* Miss. I did 129 slow pushups in April (12 out of 30 days: 40%). My 4 month streak of doing fewer pushups each month continues... but this month I did switch it up to do even slower pushups than the month before. Instead of resting at the bottom and top of each pushup, I'm trying to keep a constant slow speed at all times. I learned this in slow weights a few years ago and it makes them much harder while also making it harder to "cheat" by hopping up and down too fast.

*New goal:* Do more than 129 slow pushups (only count first set) on 13 or more days. 

##### Apr 1st 2014: 
*Weight:* 173.3 (-0.8) 

*Outcome of previous goal:* Miss. I did 148 slow pushups in March (13 out of 31 days: 42%), but I went from a best of 15 to a best of 18, for a 20% improvement. Totally fell off the wagon (and so far in the first few days of April still off the wagon). Also got sick and didn't get down to 167.1 lbs -- still hovering above 170. Sort of a loser of a month for me all around. Oops!

*New goal:* Do more than 148 slow pushups (only count first set) on 14 or more days. 

##### Mar 1st 2014: 
*Weight:* 174.1 (+1.6) 

*Outcome of previous goal:* Miss. I did 183 slow pushups in Feb (19 out of 28 days: 68%), but I went from a best of 12 to a best of 15, for a 25% improvement. They're definitely starting to feel easier, and I feel like my form is improving. 

*New goal:* Do more than 183 slow pushups (only count first set) on 20 or more days. Also, lose 4% of my weight and get to 167.1 lbs.

##### Feb 1st 2014: 
*Weight:* 172.7 (-0.5)

*Outcome of previous goal:* Hit. I'm only counting the first set of the day, as I found I'm more likely to find the time if I only focus on 1 set. Did 192 last month on 20 out of 28 days. I'm also using pushup bars and doing them in as close to perfect form as I can, very slowly. Finding that 10 slow, good posture pushups is pretty tough. On days when I'm not feeling it, I am fine with doing only a couple -- doing them every day (eventually) is more important than doing a whole bunch on a single day. I want to make this a life-long goal, something I do every day even when I'm 80 years old.

*New goal:* Do more than 192 pushups (only count first set) on 20 or more days.

*Quality moments from previous month:*
* 3rd-5th: Nursing Kellianne with her healing foot post-surgery. Fun for Niko and I to take care of her and watch her watch all of Doctor Who.
* 10th: Hack week at work, won. 
* 12th: Went to Children's Fairyland with Niko, Brasa, Bode, Alykah, Zuri, Spike, Indy, Juniper.
* 18th: Dinner at Anneke and Casey's (first time at their place)
* 20th: Long bike ride with Niko where he biked up the pedestrian bridge (both ways) without stopping!
* 23rd: My work project launched: analytics.twitter.com (super smooth launch, team is in high spirits)
* 23rd: First date night in a long time: Wood Tavern. Funny conversations with the bartender and other guests.
* 25th: Quality neighbor dinner time with Bode and Brasa while kids watched movies
* 26th: Went to the steam trains with Niko, went on the trains 3 times!
* 29th: Quality friend times with Tony Stubblebine and Sarah. They brought dinner to us.
* 30th: ModelViewCulture launch party, got to celebrate Amelia's new thing

##### Jan 1st 2014:
*Weight:* 173.2 (+1.6)

*Outcome of previous goal:* Hit

*New goal:* Do pushups at least 4 days a week, find a baseline for pushups in a month that I can try to beat next month. I need to do at least the minimal amount of exercise other than bike riding because I feel like my energy levels are really low. Admittedly, none of my interests have anything to do with pushups... I just choose them because they're the easiest. But there's no internal motivation beyond easiness pushing me forward. Is it possible to enjoy pushups for themselves? If this doesn't work I may need to rely on biking more as my outlet for exercise.

*Quality moments from previous month:* 
* 1st: Went to Scribe with Katie, met up with Mira and Tom
* 6th: Katie stayed with us, we played Cards Against Humanity
* 7th: Picked out a Christmas tree with Bojee and Alycah
* 8th: Hilarious dinner at Paisan with Katie and Jimmy James
* 15th: Went to Tilden Park Carousel with Brasa, Bojee, and friends
* 16th: Made a Thomas train out of construction paper with Niko. Big hit.
* 17th: Inspiring product manager Christmas party, going away party for Mark (our intern)
* 19th: Twitter holiday party: biggest fanciest party we've ever been to (at City Hall)
* 20th: Closed on sale of my Belltown loft! Paid off all credit cards and the car as well. Stoked.
* 21st: Christmas Tree Lane in Alameda
* 24th: Christmas Eve at Kristy's house with Mom, Ryan and Adelyn (Ryan's reading of The Night Before Christmas went over especially well)
* 25th: Adelyn saying "I'm feeling really good right now!" after opening gifts
* 26th: Delicious dinner at Sushi Kimo
* 27th: Great bike ride to Corona del Mar with Kellianne

*Self-declared badges:*
* Sold The House Badge
* Debt Free Badge

### 2013: -++++---+--++ 

##### Dec 1st 2013:

* 7th: Twitter IPO, celebrated with coworkers and Kellianne at Ryan Sarver’s get together at Tradition. I feel grateful for a chance to participate in Twitter’s history.
* 8th: Dinner with Brasa, Bojee, and Alycka at their house. I can tell we’re going to become friends.
* 10th: Took the training wheels off Niko’s bike, and discovered that he was able to ride it after only about 15 minutes of practice!
* 16-17th: Kellianne’s in Seattle so Niko and I had the weekend to ourselves. A first? Took the opportunity to super-bond with the little guy. Fave moments include biking to the Farmer’s Market, having him read The Giving Tree to me, letting him be boss and come up with rules, tossing kettle corn into each others’ mouths while relaxing on the hammock, the Muppets dance party in our living room, and the long uphill bike ride up to College Ave for an ice cream.
* 21st: Highly enjoyable conversation with Tony Stubblebine at Smuggler’s Cove.

* 30th: Katie visits and amongst other things a beautiful golden hour bike ride at the park.

##### Nov 2013:
*Weight:* 171.6 (+0.5)

*Outcome of previous goal:* Miss

*New goal:* I want to continue to track my modes through Lift at least 5 days a week. Write a blog post sometime in the month about finding the signal for quality time.

##### Oct 2013:
*Weight:* 171.1 (+0.9)

*Outcome of previous goal:* Miss

*New goal:* I want to continue to track my modes through Lift at least 5 days a week. And also, I want to write a blog post sometime in the month about finding a signal for quality time that isn’t so ambiguous.

##### Sep 2013:
*Weight:* 170.2

*Outcome of previous goal:* Hit

*New goal:* I want to continue to track my modes through Lift at least 5 days a week, and in addition track whether or not I experience quality time that matches the given mode. For example, quality sleep in recovery mode, meditation in self mode, quality time with someone in people mode, etc.

*Outcome of previous goal:* Miss

*New goal:* I want to track at least 5 "quality times" a week. Quality times that count: quality time with Kellianne, Niko, myself, and work. I'm using a new app to track this, that my friend April passed along to me, it's called The Way of Life (iPhone). It's worth checking out.

##### Jun 2013:
*Outcome of previous goal:* Miss

*New goal:** Meditate at least 5 minutes 5 days a week.

##### May 2013:
*Outcome of previous goal:* Hit

*New goal:* I want to do at least 1 thing a day (no days off) that A) gets me closer to being a marathoner B) I do on purpose for this resolution (no retroactive counting), and C) isn't "normal" for me to do. Meditation, running, other exercise, etc all count. I'm tracking my slogs on peabrain.co which has been working for me for a while now.

##### Apr 2013:

*New goal:* Meditate for at least 5 minutes a day, at least 6 days a week.
