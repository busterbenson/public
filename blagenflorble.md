All that you touch
you change.
All that you change
changes you.
&mdash; Parable of the Sower, by Octavia Butler

We must transform ourselves
to transform the world.
&mdash; Grace Lee Boggs

The way forward is with a broken heart.
&mdash; Alice Walker

What does a life deserving of human dignity require?
&mdash; Martha Nussman

Embracing a love ethic means that we utilize all the dimensions of love — 'care, commitment, trust, responsibility, respect, and knowledge' — in our everyday lives. We can successfully do this only by cultivating awareness. Being aware enables us to critically examine our actions to see what is needed so that we can give care, be responsible, show respect, and indicate a willingness to learn. 
&mdash; bell hooks in All About Love

### Blagenflorble Heart
A [blagenflorble heart](https://buster.medium.com/46-a-blagenflorble-heart-31bc2a992a83) isn’t concerned with repairing itself after every heartbreak. That feels like futile task. A blagenflorble heart is about expanding the awareness of our hearts to allow ourselves to be both whole and broken at the same time. It’s about shifting from a mindset of feeling only one emotion at a time (and laboring to repair it each time it is hurt), to allowing all of the emotions to co-exist simultaneously, and being able to zoom in on each of them without negating the others.
