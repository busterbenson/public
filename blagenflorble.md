All that you touch
you change.
All that you change
changes you.
&mdash; Parable of the Sower, by Octavia Butler

We must transform ourselves
to transform the world.
&mdash; Grace Lee Boggs

The way forward is with a broken heart.
&mdash; Alice Walker

### A blagenflorble heart
A [blagenflorble heart](https://buster.medium.com/46-a-blagenflorble-heart-31bc2a992a83) isn’t concerned with repairing itself after every heartbreak. That feels like futile task. A blagenflorble heart is about expanding the awareness of our hearts to allow ourselves to be both whole and broken at the same time. It’s about shifting from a mindset of feeling only one emotion at a time (and laboring to repair it each time it is hurt), to allowing all of the emotions to co-exist simultaneously, and being able to zoom in on each of them without negating the others.
